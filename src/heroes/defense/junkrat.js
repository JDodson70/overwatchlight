      ROLE
      DEFENSE
      DIFFICULTY
      Junkrat’s area-denying armaments include a Frag Launcher that lobs bouncing grenades, Concussion Mines that send enemies flying, and Steel Traps that stop foes dead in their tracks.

      ABILITIES

      FRAG LAUNCHER
      Junkrat's Frag Launcher lobs grenades a significant distance. They bounce to reach their destination, and blow up when they strike an enemy.


      CONCUSSION MINE
      After placing one of his homemade Concussion Mines, Junkrat can trigger it to damage enemies and send them flying... or propel himself through the air.


      STEEL TRAP
      Junkrat tosses out a giant, metal-toothed trap. Should an enemy wander too close to the trap, it clamps on, injuring and immobilizing them.


      TOTAL MAYHEM
      Junkrat's deranged sense of humor persists past his death. If killed, he drops several live grenades.


      RIP-TIRE
      Junkrat revs up a motorized tire bomb and sends it rolling across the battlefield, climbing over walls and obstacles. He can remotely detonate the RIP-Tire to deal serious damage to enemies caught in the blast, or just wait for it to explode on its own.

      BIOGRAPHY
      Real Name: Hanzo Shimada, Age: 38
      Occupation: Mercenary, Assassin
      Base of Operations: Hanamura, Japan (formerly)
      Affiliation: Shimada Clan
      “WITH EVERY DEATH COMES HONOR. WITH HONOR, REDEMPTION.”

      Mastering his skills as a bowman and an assassin, Hanzo Shimada strives to prove himself as a warrior without peer.

      The Shimada family was established centuries ago, a clan of assassins whose power grew over the years, enabling them to build a vast criminal empire that profited from lucrative trade in arms and illegal substances. As the eldest son of the family's head, Hanzo was bound by duty to succeed his father and rule the Shimada empire. From a young age, he was trained for that responsibility, displaying a natural aptitude for leadership and possessing an innate understanding of strategy and tactics. He also excelled in more practical areas: he was a prodigy in martial arts, swordplay, and bowmanship.

      Upon the death of his father, the clan elders instructed Hanzo to straighten out his wayward younger brother so that he, too, might help rule the Shimada empire. When his brother refused, Hanzo was forced to kill him. This act broke Hanzo's heart and drove him to reject his father's legacy, ultimately leading him to abandon the clan and all that he had worked so hard to attain.
