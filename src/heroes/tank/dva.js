  ROLE

  TANK

  D.Va’s mech is nimble and powerful—its twin Fusion Cannons blast away with autofire at short range, and she can use its Boosters to barrel over enemies and obstacles, or deflect attacks with her projectile-dismantling Defense Matrix.

  ABILITIES

  FUSION CANNONS
  D.Va's mech is equipped with twin short-range rotating cannons. They lay down continuous, high-damage fire without needing to reload, but slow D.Va’s movement while they’re active.


  LIGHT GUN
  While outside of her mech, D.Va can continue the fight with a mid-range automatic blaster.


  BOOSTERS
  D.Va’s mech launches into the air, her momentum carrying her forward. She can turn and change directions or barrel through her enemies, knocking them back.


  DEFENSE MATRIX
  D.Va can maintain this forward-facing targeting array for a short period of time; while active, it'll stop incoming projectiles.


  MICRO MISSILES
  D.Va launches a volley of explosive rockets.


  SELF-DESTRUCT
  D.Va ejects from her mech and sets its reactor to explode, dealing massive damage to nearby opponents.


  CALL MECH
  If her armored battle suit is destroyed, D.Va can call down a fresh mech and return to the fray.
