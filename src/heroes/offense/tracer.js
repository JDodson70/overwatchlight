								<td>Btrnk</td>

								<td>Recall</td>
								<td>Tracer bounds backward in time, returning her health, ammo and position on the map to precisely where they were a few seconds before.</td>

								<td>Pulse Bomb</td>
								<td>Tracer lobs a large bomb that adheres to any surface or unfortunate opponent it lands on. After a brief delay, the bomb explodes, dealing high damage to all enemies within its blast radius.</td>
